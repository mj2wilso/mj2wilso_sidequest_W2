## Iteration Notes

I changed the blobs appearances by reducing the points and radius it is drawn with to make it appear smaller. I increased the wobble amount, frequency, and speed to create a jittery affect on the blob. For the blob movement for left and right and jumping, I increased the speed to make the blob appear as spooked and snappy. The gravity for when the blob is coming down from a jump, I decreased to make it more rushed and a heavier drop. I also altered the ground friction code to make my blob appear more frantic and scared through sliding on the ground when jumping or coming to a stop from movement. Finally, I changed the blob colour to purple as that is the known colour to represent the emotion fear.
